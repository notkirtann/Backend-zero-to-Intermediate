NODE JS NOTES

its a javascript runtime

Nodejs is a different version of javascript you could say, it is basically built on javascript, it adds

some features to it, is not capable of doing some other things you can do with javascript in the browser,

so it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment. 

gives file system library in node js
using require function with 'fs'


OTHER CORE MODULES
-https - launch SSL server encrypt
-http - launch server send rqst
-fs
-path
-os

window object for browser and global for node environment.
both use chromes v8 engine for compiling and executing code to machine language.

DOM not in node but is there in browser
process is there in node but not in bowser
 
node uses non blocking I/O

Section 1,2,3
-node module system
	importing core node modules
	importing 3rd party modules
	importing self created modules

-file system 
	require fs
	fs.writeFileSync
	fs.appendFileSync
	fs.readFileSync
	fs.mkdirSync() {recursive true create all the directoy}
	fs.rmdirSync() {if emtyp andar waali phele delete)
	fs.unlinkSync() //delete the file

	Sync - Blocking operation 
	
	remove sync make async take callback
	
	eg.
	 fs.readFile('notes.txt','utf-8',(error,data)=>{
		if(error) conslog(error)
		else conslog (data)	
	} //async non blocking
	
	- two different file cannot access scope(variable) of each   	other using require due to scope. 
	-can be done using export function

to use common js module as default 'type': 'commonjs' and use es module in same file use extension as app.mjs.

to use module js module as default 'type': 'module' and use common JS in same file use extension as app.cjs.

- events 
	-on (define first code)
	-emit()
	-once() //emit once if called twice wont run wont throw error
	-removeListner('example') //after removing wont run that particular event name example again.
	- listners() //tell how many people listening to event
	-so many more

	EVENTS CLASS 
	add all events in class and using class syntax access events
	 
- http module
	- request/response cycle
	- HTTP METHODS
	(GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE)
	-https status code (eg 404)

EXPLANATION 
client send a request(HTTP MEHODS) can be GET POST DELETE

 	-GET when client want to get some data from server.
		eg: see all the tweets, watch video, see comment
	-POST when client want to send some data to server
		eg: create a tweet, upload a video
	-PATCH when client want to update some existing data 
	-DELETE when client want to delete some data from server

STATUS CODES are part of response 
when we request in retrun we get response i.e. http status code these are just bunch of number (100-599)
	404 - error finding not found
	500 - internal server error
	401 - unauthorized
	200 - everythings ok
	400 - bad request
	201 - ok and created
	301 - rediret

	100-199 => Informational resp
	200-299 => Successful res
	300-399 => Redirection msg 
	400-499 => client error res
	500-599 => server error res

http contain mainly
	1. http version

	2. URL - scheme -subdomain - naked domain - path - query parameter eg: https:// | www.| google.com | /about?| q=xyz&sort=des

	3. an HTTP method

	4. HTTP request headers (key value pair for every http method you provide extra data that is http header like TCP/IP we provide same way here but different things inside header) 
	eg: Content Type : 'application/json'
	    Authorization : TOKEN
	others are authority method path scheme accept user-agent	
	5. Optional HTTP Body 
	-in GET its optional
	-in POST its important like username password
	
learn about npm module manually importing it from npm web @use to write version to download
eg 	validator, 
	chalk (color)
	nodemon -g(for globally install module in our pc)
	yargs
these are stored locally

we can also use global module


Modules in Node.js
	-Used to split code into multiple files.
	-Each file is a separate module.
	-Use require() to import and module.exports to export.

ES Module Syntax (Modern Way)
	-Uses import and export keywords.
	-Works when "type": "module" is added in package.json

Using External Packages
	-npm install chalk validator yargs

Command Line Arguments
	-Accessed using process.argv
	-Returns an array of all arguments.

General Learnings
-Learned how to connect multiple files.
-Understood module.exports and require.
-Used npm packages (chalk, validator, yargs).
-Understood command-line input handling.
-Practiced ES module syntax.


Section 4,5

yargs Package
	- Used for better command-line argument handling.
	- getting user input from user
	- argument parsing with yargs
	- deep dive into yargs and its working and syntax
storing data with JSON
	-saving data in json format 
	-accessing the data
	- conversion of data in multiple form(binary json object)

SECTION 6
-Asynchronous Basics
- CallStack, Callback Queue, and Event Loop
- Making http request (weather stack)
- npm module request
- customizing http(language, temp,auto parse)
- handling error in api,edge cases also
-can be done using fetch/async in new ES6 module

notes
callback function cant return value as it will execute when main is empty


SECTION 7 EXPRESS JS

Express is a libary used for creating node server 

-get = when someone tries to get something at a specific route?
	We set that up using a get method on app
	This lets us configure what the server should do
	when someone tries to get the resource at a specific URL.
	Maybe we should be sending back HTML,
	or maybe we should be sending back JSON.
	takes two argurment 'website location', (fucntion)

funtion itself take two argument(request, response)

- req = The first is an object containing information
	about the incoming request to the server.
	This is commonly called REQ, which is short for request.

- res = So this contains a bunch of methods allowing us
	to customize what we're gonna send back to the requester.
	This is commonly called RES, which is short for response

- send = this allows us to send something back to requester

send() vs end()

directly imported from http module .send is smarter version of end
//prefer .send over .end

SEND=>
Serializes the data to a JSON string and sets the Content-Type to application/json.
(Headers: It automatically sets useful headers like Content-Type and Content-Length.
Use Case: This is the standard and recommended way to send most responses in an Express application.)

END=>
You would need to use res.writeHead() or res.setHeader() manually before calling res.end().
It's rarely used directly in modern Express applications unless you are dealing with low-level streaming or you have a very specific need to bypass Express's helper methods.
